# FrontEnd-Challenge 3 - Landing Page for Manage

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. <br>

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

**Mange Landing Page** challenge involved building a static responsive site using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML and CSS was used for layouting and posiitoning aspects. A carousel for the testimonial section was required to be implemented which was done along with JavaScript. The challenge involves both desktop and mobile version and this site is based on Mobile First.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to [purchase here](https://bmc.xyz/l/zei2aMuw0).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
